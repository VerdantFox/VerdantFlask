  <h1>Loan Calculator</h1>
  <p>
    Use this loan calculator to see how your loan changes based on changing
    conditions. You can adjust the initial loan amount, the loan period,
    the interest rate and additional payments made on top of the monthly minimum.
  </p>
  <p>
    See how changes to these categories change how much interest you pay
    over the course of the loan, how they affect your monthly payments,
    and how they affect your estimated payoff date.
    View your amortization schedule and charts reflecting principal and interest
    paid at various points over the course of the loan. This calculator can
    be used for school loan, mortgage, auto and any other fixed loan types.
