      Games are fun! They are fun to build and fun to play. They can be an
      exciting conduit to learning new programming languages or new programming
      techniques. Here are a few of the games I've built over the course learning
      to program that have allowed me to learn interesting new concepts.

      In this app I have 3 games for display. The first, Batty's Moth
      Hunt is a game built with MIT's Scratch, a learning language. Play
      as a bat, hunting down moths in the night while running from the
      scary owl. Then we have Twisted Towers, a tower defense game built
      with Pygame, a python library. Build towers to fend off the horde
      of enemies trying to take your castle. Finally, there's Connect 4,
      the classic board game (built with Python) where you try to connect
      4 of your chips in a row, playing against my AI, Mr. Roboto.
      Good luck!
