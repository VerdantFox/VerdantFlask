      Here you will find a series of mini-apps I created that perform some
      simple, fun tasks. These were little ideas I created for classes or
      that I thought up and thought "That would be fun to create or
      could be useful in some context". Then I spent a couple hours each
      writing them up and testing them.

      Additionally, these were the first "apps" I wrote for this Django
      website, and since they were conceptually simple to create and
      implement, they were useful for helping me figure out some of
      the mechanics of the app which can be difficult to wrap one's
      head around when learning for the first time, like how to make
      requests, work with forms, and other seemingly trivial tasks
      that take longer than you'd like when learning something new.

        Check out Simple!
